## Features

 - When a layout is chosen that increases the pane count, any additional panes will be left empty.
 - When a layout is chosen that decreases the pane count, any left over panes will be collapsed into the last one.
 - When switching to a layout from a custom layout, any left over panes will be collapsed into the last one.

## TODO

 - If a layout is chosen, that is already active, do nothing.
 - Investigate more efficient ways of building layouts.
