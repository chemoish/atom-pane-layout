## Nitty Gritty

 - When a layout is chosen that increases the pane count, any additional panes will be left empty.
 - When a layout is chosen that decreases the pane count, any left over panes will be collapsed into the last available pane.
 - When a layout is chosen and a custom layout is already in place, any left over panes will be collapsed into the last available pane.
 - When a layout is changed that causes panes to collapse, stay focused on the active file – iff the file is in the file system.
