# Atom.io – Pane Layout Package

> Set the layout of your atom editor with `cmd-alt-1`, `cmd-alt-2`, `cmd-alt-3`, `cmd-alt-4`, `cmd-alt-5`.

## Features

 - When a layout is chosen that increases the pane count, any additional panes will be left empty.
 - When a layout is chosen that decreases the pane count, any left over panes will be collapsed into the last available pane.
 - When a layout is chosen and a custom layout is already in place, any left over panes will be collapsed into the last available pane.
 - When a layout is changed that causes panes to collapse, stay focused on the active file – iff the file is in the file system.

## TODO

 - If a layout is chosen, that is already active, do nothing.
 - Investigate more efficient ways of building layouts.
